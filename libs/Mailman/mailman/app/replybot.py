    * The message has a X-No-Ack header with any value
    * The message has an X-Ack header with a 'no' value
    * The message has a Precedence header
    * The message has an Auto-Submitted header and that header does not have a
      value of 'no'
    * The message has an empty Return-Path header, e.g. <>
    * The message has any RFC 2369 headers (i.e. List-* headers)
