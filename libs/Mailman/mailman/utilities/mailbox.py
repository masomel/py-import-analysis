"""MMDF helper for digests."""

# Use a single file format for the digest mailbox because this makes it easier
# to calculate the current size of the mailbox.  This way, we don't have to
# carry around or store the size of the mailbox, we can just stat the file to
# get its size.  MMDF is slightly more sane than mbox; it's primary advantage
# for us is that it does no 'From' mangling.
