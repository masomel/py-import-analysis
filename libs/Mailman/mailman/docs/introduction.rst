Mailman - The GNU Mailing List Management System
================================================

This is `GNU Mailman`_, a mailing list management system distributed under the
terms of the `GNU General Public License`_ (GPL) version 3 or later.

Mailman is written in Python_, a free object-oriented programming language.
Python is available for all platforms that Mailman is supported on, which
includes GNU/Linux and most other Unix-like operating systems (e.g. Solaris,
\*BSD, MacOSX, etc.).  Mailman is not supported on Windows, although web and
mail clients on any platform should be able to interact with Mailman just
fine.

GNU Mailman 3 consists of a `suite of programs`_ that work together:

* Mailman Core; the core delivery engine.  This is where you are right now.
* Postorius; the web user interface for list members and administrators.
* HyperKitty; the web-based archiver
* Mailman client; the official Python bindings for talking to the Core's REST
  administrative API.

Only the Core is required.  You can write or integrate your own web user
interface or archiver that speaks to the Core over its REST API.  The REST API
is a pure HTTP-based API so you don't *have* to use Python, or even our
official bindings.  And you can deploy whatever components you want using
whatever mechanisms you want.

But we really like Postorius and HyperKitty and hope you will too!

Spelling

The name of this software is spelled `Mailman` with a leading capital `M`
but with a lower case second `m`.  Any other spelling is incorrect.  Its full
name is `GNU Mailman` but is often referred colloquially as `Mailman`.


History
=======

Mailman was originally developed by John Viega in the mid-1990s.  Subsequent
development (through version 1.0b3) was by Ken Manheimer.  Further work
towards the 1.0 final release was a group effort, with the core contributors
being: Barry Warsaw, Ken Manheimer, Scott Cotton, Harald Meland, and John
Viega.  Since version 1.0 the project has been led by Barry Warsaw with
contributions from many; see the `ACKNOWLEDGMENTS`_ file for details.  Jeremy
Hylton helped considerably with the Pipermail code in Mailman 2.0.  Mailman
2.1 is primarily maintained by Mark Sapiro, with previous help by Tokio
Kikuchi (RIP).  Barry Warsaw is the lead developer on Mailman 3.  Aur√©lien
Bompard and Florian Fuchs lead development of Postorius and HyperKitty.
Abhilash Raj is a core developer contributing to all the bits and maintains
the CI infrastructure.
