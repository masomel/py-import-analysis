"""Incoming runner.

This runner's sole purpose in life is to decide the disposition of the
message.  It can either be accepted for delivery, rejected (i.e. bounced),
held for moderator approval, or discarded.

When accepted, the message is forwarded on to the `prep queue` where it is
prepared for delivery.  Rejections, discards, and holds are processed
immediately.
