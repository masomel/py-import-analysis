"""Moderation chain.

When a member or nonmember posting to the mailing list has a moderation action
that is not `defer`, the built-in chain jumps to this chain.  This chain then
determines the disposition of the message based on the member's or nonmember's
moderation action.

For example, these actions jump to the appropriate terminal chain:

    * accept - the message is immediately accepted
    * hold - the message is held for moderator approval
    * reject - the message is bounced
    * discard - the message is immediately thrown away

Note that if the moderation action is `defer` then the normal decisions are
made as to the disposition of the message.  `defer` is the default for
members, while `hold` is the default for nonmembers.
